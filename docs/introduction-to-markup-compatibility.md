# Introduction to markup compatibility (Open XML SDK)

This topic introduces the markup compatibility features included in the
Open XML SDK 2.5 for Office.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Introduction 
Suppose you have a Microsoft Word 2013 document that employs a feature
introduced in Microsoft Office 2013. When you open that document in
Microsoft Word 2010, an earlier version, what should happen? Ideally,
you want the document to remain interoperable with Word 2010, even
though Word 2010 will not understand the new feature.

Consider also what should happen if you open that document in a
hypothetical later version of Office. Here too, you want the document to
work as expected. That is, you want the later version of Office to
understand and support a feature employed in a document produced by Word
2013.

Open XML anticipates these scenarios. The Office Open XML File Formats
specification describes facilities for achieving the above desired
outcomes in [ECMA-376, Second Edition, Part 3 - Markup Compatibility and Extensibility](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-376,%20Second%20Edition,%20Part%203%20-%20Markup%20Compatibility%20and%20Extensibility.zip).

The Open XML SDK 2.5 supports markup compatibility in a way that makes
it easy for you to achieve the above desired outcomes for and Office
2013 without having to necessarily become an expert in the specification
details.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## What is Markup Compatibility? 
Open XML defines formats for word-processing, spreadsheet and
presentation documents in the form of specific markup languages, namely
WordprocessingML, SpreadsheetML, and PresentationML. With respect to the
Open XML file formats, markup compatibility is the ability for a
document expressed in one of the above markup languages to facilitate
interoperability between applications, or versions of an application,
with different feature sets. This is supported through the use of a
defined set of XML elements and attributes in the Markup Compatibility
namespace of the Open XML specification. Notice that while the markup is
supported in the document format, markup producers and consumers, such
as Microsoft Word, must support it as well. In other words,
interoperability is a function of support both in the file format and by
applications.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Markup Compatibility in the Open XML File Formats Specification 
Markup compatibility is discussed in [ECMA-376, Second Edition, Part 3 - Markup Compatibility and Extensibility](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-376,%20Second%20Edition,%20Part%203%20-%20Markup%20Compatibility%20and%20Extensibility.zip),
which is recommended reading to understand markup compatibility. The
specification defines XML attributes to express compatibility rules, and
XML elements to specify alternate content. For example, the **Ignorable** attribute specifies namespaces that can
be ignored when they are not understood by the consuming application.
Alternate-Content elements specify markup alternatives that can be
chosen by an application at run time. For example, Word 2013 can choose
only the markup alternative that it recognizes. The complete list of
compatibility-rule attributes and alternate-content elements and their
details can be found in the specification.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Open XML SDK 2.5 Support for Markup Compatibility 
The work that the Open XML SDK 2.5 does for markup compatibility is
detailed and subtle. However, the goal can be summarized as: using
settings that you assign when you open a document, preprocess the
document to:

1.  Filter or remove any elements from namespaces that will not be
    understood (for example, Office 2013 document opened in Office 2010
    context)

2.  Process any markup compatibility elements and attributes as
    specified in the Open XML specification.

The preprocessing performed is in accordance with ECMA-376, Second
Edition: Part 3.13.

The Open XML SDK 2.5 support for markup compatibility comes primarily in
the form of two classes and in the manner in which content is
preprocessed in accordance with ECMA-376, Second Edition. The two
classes are **OpenSettings** and **MarkupCompatibilityProcessSettings**. Use the
former to provide settings that apply to SDK behavior overall. Use the
latter to supply one part of those settings, specifically those that
apply to markup compatibility.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Setting the stage when you Open 
When you open a document using the Open XML SDK 2.5, you have the option
of using an overload with a signature that accepts an instance of the
**[OpenSettings](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/documentformat.openxml.packaging.opensettings.aspx)** class as a parameter. You use
the open settings class to provide certain important settings that
govern the behavior of the SDK. One set of settings in particular,
stored in the **[MarkupCompatibilityProcessSettings](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/documentformat.openxml.packaging.opensettings.markupcompatibilityprocesssettings.aspx)**
property, determines how markup compatibility elements and attributes
are processed. You set the property to an instance of the **[MarkupCompatibilityProcessSettings](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/documentformat.openxml.packaging.markupcompatibilityprocesssettings.aspx)** class
prior to opening a document.

The class has the following properties:

-   
    **[ProcessMode](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/documentformat.openxml.packaging.markupcompatibilityprocesssettings.processmode.aspx)** - Determines the
    parts that are preprocessed.

-   
    **[TargetFileFormatVersions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/documentformat.openxml.packaging.markupcompatibilityprocesssettings.targetfileformatversions.aspx)** -
    Specifies the context that applies to preprocessing.

By default, documents are not preprocessed. If however you do specify
open settings and provide markup compatibility process settings, then
the document is preprocessed in accordance with those settings.

The following code example demonstrates how to call the Open method with
an instance of the open settings class as a parameter. Notice that the
**ProcessMode** and **TargetFileFormatVersions** properties are
initialized as part of the **MarkupCompatiblityProcessSettings** constructor.

```csharp
    // Create instance of OpenSettings
    OpenSettings openSettings = new OpenSettings();

    // Add the MarkupCompatibilityProcessSettings
    openSettings.MarkupCompatibilityProcessSettings =
        new MarkupCompatibilityProcessSettings(
            MarkupCompatibilityProcessMode.ProcessAllParts, 
            FileFormatVersions.Office2007);

    // Open the document with OpenSettings
    using (WordprocessingDocument wordDocument = 
        WordprocessingDocument.Open(filename, 
            true,
            openSettings))
    {
        // ... more code here
    }
```

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## What Happens During Preprocessing 
During preprocessing, the Open XML SDK 2.5 removes elements and
attributes in the markup compatibility namespace, removing the contents
of unselected alternate-content elements, and interpreting
compatibility-rule attributes as appropriate. This work is guided by the
process mode and target file format versions properties.

The **ProcessMode** property determines the
parts to be preprocessed. The content in *those* parts is filtered to
contain only elements that are understood by the application version
indicated in the **TargetFileFormatVersions**
property.

> [!WARNING]
> Preprocessing affects what gets saved. When you save a file, the only markup that is saved is that which remains after preprocessing.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Understanding Process Mode 
The process mode specifies which document parts should be preprocessed.
You set this property to a member of the **[MarkupCompatibilityProcessMode](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/documentformat.openxml.packaging.markupcompatibilityprocessmode.aspx)** enumeration.
The default value, **NoProcess**, indicates
that no preprocessing is performed. Your application must be able to
understand and handle any elements and attributes present in the
document markup, including any of the elements and attributes in the
Markup Compatibility namespace.

You might want to work on specific document parts while leaving the rest
untouched. For example, you might want to ensure minimal modification to
the file. In that case, specify **ProcessLoadedPartsOnly** for the process mode. With
this setting, preprocessing and the associated filtering is only applied
to the loaded document parts, not the entire document.

Finally, there is **ProcessAllParts**, which
specifies what the name implies. When you choose this value, the entire
document is preprocessed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Setting the Target File Format Version 
The target file format versions property lets you choose to process
markup compatibility content in either Office 2010 or Office 2013
context. Set the **TargetFileFormatVersions**
property to a member of the **[FileFormatVersions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/documentformat.openxml.fileformatversions.aspx)** enumeration.

The default value, **Office2010**, means the
SDK will assume that namespaces defined in Office 2010 are understood,
but not namespaces defined in Office 2013. Thus, during preprocessing,
the SDK will ignore the namespaces defined in Office 2013 and choose the
Office 2010 compatible alternate-content.

When you set the target file format versions property to **Office2013**, the Open XML SDK 2.5 assumes that all
of the namespaces defined in Office 2010 and Office 2013 are understood,
does not ignore any content defined under Office 2013, and will choose
the Office 2013 compatible alternate-content.
