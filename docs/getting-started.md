# Getting started with the Open XML SDK 2.5 for Office</td>

The Open XML SDK 2.5 for Office simplifies the task of manipulating Open XML packages and the underlying Open XML schema elements within a package. The classes in the Open XML SDK 2.5 encapsulate many common tasks that developers perform on Open XML packages, so that you can perform complex operations with just a few lines of code.


------------------------------------------------------------
## Using the Classes in the Open XML SDK
Using the classes in the Open XML SDK 2.5 is simple. When you have installed the Open XML SDK 2.5, open your existing project or application in Visual Studio, or create a new project or application. Then, in your project or application, add references to the following components.

-   **DocumentFormat.OpenXml**

-   **WindowsBase**

### To add a reference in a Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 project

1.  In Solution Explorer, right-click <span class="ui">References</span> and then click <span class="ui">Add Reference</span>. If the <span class="ui">References</span> node is not visible, click <span class="ui">Project</span> and then click <span class="ui">Show All Files</span>.

2.  In the <span class="ui">Add Reference</span> dialog box, click <span class="ui">.NET</span>.

3.  In the Component Name column, select the components (scroll if you need to), and then click <span class="ui">OK</span>.

> [!TIP]  
> To select more than one component, hold down the Ctrl key and click each component.

The added components are displayed in the References section in Solution Explorer.
