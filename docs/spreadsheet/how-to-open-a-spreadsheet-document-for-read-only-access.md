# Open a spreadsheet document for read-only access

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for
Office to open a spreadsheet document for read-only access
programmatically.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## When to Open a Document for Read-Only Access
Sometimes you want to open a document to inspect or retrieve some
information, and you want to do this in a way that ensures the document
remains unchanged. In these instances, you want to open the document for
read-only access. This How To topic discusses several ways to
programmatically open a read-only spreadsheet document.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Getting a SpreadsheetDocument Object
In the Open XML SDK, the [SpreadsheetDocument](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/office/documentformat.openxml.packaging.spreadsheetdocument.aspx) class represents an
Excel document package. To create an Excel document, you create an
instance of the **SpreadsheetDocument** class
and populate it with parts. At a minimum, the document must have a
workbook part that serves as a container for the document, and at least
one worksheet part. The text is represented in the package as XML using
SpreadsheetML markup.

To create the class instance from the document that you call one of the
[Open()](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/office/documentformat.openxml.packaging.spreadsheetdocument.open.aspx) overload methods. Several **Open** methods are provided, each with a different
signature. The methods that let you specify whether a document is
editable are listed in the following table.

|Open|Class Library Reference Topic|Description|
--|--|--
Open(String, Boolean)|[Open(String, Boolean)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/office/cc562356.aspx)|Create an instance of the SpreadsheetDocument class from the specified file.
Open(Stream, Boolean)|[Open(Stream, Boolean](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/office/cc562185.aspx)|Create an instance of the SpreadsheetDocument class from the specified IO stream.
Open(String, Boolean, OpenSettings)|[Open(String, Boolean, OpenSettings)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/office/ee880344.aspx)|Create an instance of the SpreadsheetDocument class from the specified file.
Open(Stream, Boolean, OpenSettings)|[Open(Stream, Boolean, OpenSettings)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/office/ee840773.aspx)|Create an instance of the SpreadsheetDocument class from the specified I/O stream.

The table earlier in this topic lists only those **Open** methods that accept a Boolean value as the
second parameter to specify whether a document is editable. To open a
document for read-only access, specify **False** for this parameter.

Notice that two of the **Open** methods create
an instance of the SpreadsheetDocument class based on a string as the
first parameter. The first example in the sample code uses this
technique. It uses the first **Open** method in
the table earlier in this topic; with a signature that requires two
parameters. The first parameter takes a string that represents the full
path file name from which you want to open the document. The second
parameter is either **true** or **false**. This example uses **false** and indicates that you want to open the
file as read-only.

The following code example calls the **Open**
Method.

### [C#](#tab/cs-0)
```csharp
    // Open a SpreadsheetDocument for read-only access based on a filepath.
    using (SpreadsheetDocument spreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(filepath, false))
```

### [Visual Basic](#tab/vb-0)
```vb
    ' Open a SpreadsheetDocument for read-only access based on a filepath.
    Using spreadsheetDocument As SpreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(filepath, False)
```
***


The other two **Open** methods create an
instance of the SpreadsheetDocument class based on an input/output
stream. You might use this approach, for example, if you have a
Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010 application that uses stream
input/output, and you want to use the Open XML SDK to work with a
document.

The following code example opens a document based on a stream.

### [C#](#tab/cs-1)
```csharp
    Stream stream = File.Open(strDoc, FileMode.Open);
    // Open a SpreadsheetDocument for read-only access based on a stream.
    using (SpreadsheetDocument spreadsheetDocument =
        SpreadsheetDocument.Open(stream, false))
```

### [Visual Basic](#tab/vb-1)
```vb
    Dim stream As Stream = File.Open(strDoc, FileMode.Open)
    ' Open a SpreadsheetDocument for read-only access based on a stream.
    Using spreadsheetDocument As SpreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(stream, False)
```
***


Suppose you have an application that uses the Open XML support in the
System.IO.Packaging namespace of the .NET Framework Class Library, and
you want to use the Open XML SDK to work with a package as
read-only. Whereas the Open XML SDK includes method overloads that
accept a **Package** as the first parameter,
there is not one that takes a Boolean as the second parameter to
indicate whether the document should be opened for editing.

The recommended method is to open the package as read-only at first,
before creating the instance of the **SpreadsheetDocument** class, as shown in the second
example in the sample code. The following code example performs this
operation.

### [C#](#tab/cs-2)
```csharp
    // Open System.IO.Packaging.Package.
    Package spreadsheetPackage = Package.Open(filepath, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read);

    // Open a SpreadsheetDocument based on a package.
    using (SpreadsheetDocument spreadsheetDocument =
        SpreadsheetDocument.Open(spreadsheetPackage))
```

### [Visual Basic](#tab/vb-2)
```vb
    ' Open System.IO.Packaging.Package.
    Dim spreadsheetPackage As Package = Package.Open(filepath, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read)

    ' Open a SpreadsheetDocument based on a package.
    Using spreadsheetDocument As SpreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(spreadsheetPackage)
```
***


After you open the spreadsheet document package, you can access the main
workbook part. To access the main workbook part, you assign a reference
to the existing workbook part, as shown in the following code example.

### [C#](#tab/cs-3)
```csharp
    // Assign a reference to the existing workbook part.
    WorkbookPart wbPart = document.WorkbookPart;
```

### [Visual Basic](#tab/vb-3)
```vb
    ' Assign a reference to the existing workbook part.
    Dim wbPart As WorkbookPart = document.WorkbookPart
```
***


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Basic Document Structure
The basic document structure of a SpreadsheetML document consists of the
[Sheets](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/office/documentformat.openxml.spreadsheet.sheets.aspx) and [Sheet](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/office/documentformat.openxml.spreadsheet.sheet.aspx) elements, which reference the
worksheets in the [Workbook](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/office/documentformat.openxml.spreadsheet.workbook.aspx). A separate XML file is created
for each [Worksheet](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/office/documentformat.openxml.spreadsheet.worksheet.aspx). For example, the SpreadsheetML
for a workbook that has two worksheets name MySheet1 and MySheet2 is
located in the Workbook.xml file and is as follows.

```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes" ?> 
    <workbook xmlns=https://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main xmlns:r="https://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships">
        <sheets>
            <sheet name="MySheet1" sheetId="1" r:id="rId1" /> 
            <sheet name="MySheet2" sheetId="2" r:id="rId2" /> 
        </sheets>
    </workbook>
```

The worksheet XML files contain one or more block level elements such as
[SheetData](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/office/documentformat.openxml.spreadsheet.sheetdata.aspx). **sheetData** represents the cell table and contains
one or more [Row](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/office/documentformat.openxml.spreadsheet.row.aspx) elements. A **row** contains one or more [Cell](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/office/documentformat.openxml.spreadsheet.cell.aspx) elements. Each cell contains a [CellValue](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/office/documentformat.openxml.spreadsheet.cellvalue.aspx) element that represents the value
of the cell. For example, the SpreadsheetML for the first worksheet in a
workbook, that only has the value 100 in cell A1, is located in the
Sheet1.xml file and is as follows.

```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?> 
    <worksheet xmlns="https://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main">
        <sheetData>
            <row r="1">
                <c r="A1">
                    <v>100</v> 
                </c>
            </row>
        </sheetData>
    </worksheet>
```

Using the Open XML SDK, you can create document structure and
content that uses strongly-typed classes that correspond to
SpreadsheetML elements. You can find these classes in the **DocumentFormat.OpenXML.Spreadsheet** namespace. The
following table lists the class names of the classes that correspond to
the **workbook**, **sheets**, **sheet**, **worksheet**, and **sheetData** elements.

SpreadsheetML Element|Open XML SDK Class|Description
--|--|--
workbook|DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet.Workbook|The root element for the main document part.
sheets|DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet.Sheets|The container for the block level structures such as sheet, fileVersion, and others specified in the [ISO/IEC 29500](https://www.iso.org/standard/71691.html) specification.
sheet|DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet.Sheet|A sheet that points to a sheet definition file.
worksheet|DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet.Worksheet|A sheet definition file that contains the sheet data.
sheetData|DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet.SheetData|The cell table, grouped together by rows.
row|DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet.Row|A row in the cell table.
c|DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet.Cell|A cell in a row.
v|DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet.CellValue|The value of a cell.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Sample Code
The following code sample is used to open a Spreadsheet Document for
Read-only Access. You can call the **OpenSpreadsheetDocumentReadonly** method by using
the following code, which opens the file "Sheet10.xlsx," as an example.

### [C#](#tab/cs-4)
```csharp
    OpenSpreadsheetDocumentReadonly(@"C:\Users\Public\Documents\Sheet10.xlsx");
```

### [Visual Basic](#tab/vb-4)
```vb
    OpenSpreadsheetDocumentReadonly("C:\Users\Public\Documents\Sheet10.xlsx")
```
***

The following is the complete sample code in both C\# and Visual Basic.

### [C#](#tab/cs)
