# Retrieve a list of the hidden worksheets in a spreadsheet document

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to programmatically retrieve a list of hidden worksheets in a Microsoft Excel 2010 or Microsoft Excel 2010 workbook, without loading the document into Excel. It contains an example **GetHiddenSheets** method to illustrate this task.

## GetHiddenSheets method

You can use the **GetHiddenSheets** method, to retrieve a list of the hidden worksheets in a workbook. The **GetHiddenSheets** method accepts a single parameter, a string that indicates the path of the file that you want to examine. The method works with the workbook you specify, filling a **[List\<T\>](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/6sh2ey19)** instance with a reference to each hidden **Sheet** object.

## Retrieve the collection of worksheets

The **WorkbookPart** class provides a **Workbook** property, which in turn contains the XML content of the workbook. Although the Open XML SDK provides the **Sheets** property, which returns a collection of the **Sheet** parts, all the information that you need is provided by the **Sheet** elements within the **Workbook** XML content.
The following code uses the **Descendants** generic method of the **Workbook** object to retrieve a collection of **Sheet** objects that contain information about all the sheet child elements of the workbook's XML content.

## Retrieve hidden sheets

It's important to be aware that Excel supports two levels of worksheets. You can hide a worksheet by using the Excel user interface by right-clicking the worksheets tab and opting to hide the worksheet.
For these worksheets, the **State** property of the **Sheet** object contains an enumerated value of **Hidden**. You can also make a worksheet very hidden by writing code (either in VBA or in another language) that sets the sheet's **Visible** property to the enumerated value **xlSheetVeryHidden**. For worksheets hidden in this manner, the **State** property of the **Sheet** object contains the enumerated value **VeryHidden**.

Given the collection that contains information about all the sheets, the following code uses the **[Where](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/bb301979)** function to filter the collection so that it contains only the sheets in which the **State** property is not null. If the **State** property is not null, the code looks for the **Sheet** objects in which the **State** property as a value, and where the value is either **SheetStateValues.Hidden** or **SheetStateValues.VeryHidden**.
