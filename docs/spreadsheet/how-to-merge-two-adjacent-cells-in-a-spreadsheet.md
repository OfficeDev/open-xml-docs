# Merge two adjacent cells in a spreadsheet document

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for
Office to merge two adjacent cells in a spreadsheet document
programmatically.

[!include[Structure](../includes/spreadsheet/structure.md)]


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Sample Code 

The following code merges two adjacent cells in a **[SpreadsheetDocument](/dotnet/api/documentformat.openxml.spreadsheet.row)** document package. When
merging two cells, only the content from one of the cells is preserved.
In left-to-right languages, the content in the upper-left cell is
preserved. In right-to-left languages, the content in the upper-right
cell is preserved.

The following is the complete sample code in both C\# and Visual Basic.

### [C#](#tab/cs)

### [Visual Basic](#tab/vb)
