# Validate a word processing document

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for
Office to programmatically validate a word processing document.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## How the Sample Code Works
This code example consists of two methods. The first method, **ValidateWordDocument**, is used to validate a
regular Word file. It doesn't throw any exceptions and closes the file
after running the validation check. The second method, **ValidateCorruptedWordDocument**, starts by
inserting some text into the body, which causes a schema error. It then
validates the Word file, in which case the method throws an exception on
trying to open the corrupted file. The validation is done by using the
[Validate](/dotnet/api/documentformat.openxml.validation.openxmlvalidator.validate) method. The code displays
information about any errors that are found, in addition to the count of
errors.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> [!Important] 
> Notice that you cannot run the code twice after corrupting the file in the first run. You have to start with a new Word file.

Following is the complete sample code in both C\# and Visual Basic.
