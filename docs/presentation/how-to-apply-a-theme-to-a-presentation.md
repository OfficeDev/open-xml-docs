# Apply a theme to a presentation

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for
Office to apply the theme from one presentation to another presentation
programmatically.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Getting a PresentationDocument Object
In the Open XML SDK, the [PresentationDocument](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/office/documentformat.openxml.packaging.presentationdocument.aspx) class represents a
presentation document package. To work with a presentation document,
first create an instance of the **PresentationDocument** class, and then work with
that instance. To create the class instance from the document call the
[Open(String, Boolean)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/office/cc562287.aspx) method that uses a
file path, and a Boolean value as the second parameter to specify
whether a document is editable. To open a document for read-only access,
specify the value **false** for this parameter.
To open a document for read/write access, specify the value **true** for this parameter. In the following **using** statement, two presentation files are
opened, the target presentation, to which to apply a theme, and the
source presentation, which already has that theme applied. The source
presentation file is opened for read-only access, and the target
presentation file is opened for read/write access. In this code, the
**themePresentation** parameter is a string
that represents the path for the source presentation document, and the
**presentationFile** parameter is a string that
represents the path for the target presentation document.

The **using** statement provides a recommended
alternative to the typical .Open, .Save, .Close sequence. It ensures
that the **Dispose** method (internal method
used by the Open XML SDK to clean up resources) is automatically called
when the closing brace is reached. The block that follows the **using** statement establishes a scope for the
object that is created or named in the **using** statement, in this case **themeDocument** and **presentationDocument**.

## Structure of the Theme Element
The following information from the [ISO/IEC 29500](https://www.iso.org/standard/71691.html) specification can
be useful when working with this element.

> This element defines the root level complex type associated with a
> shared style sheet (or theme). This element holds all the different
> formatting options available to a document through a theme, and
> defines the overall look and feel of the document when themed objects
> are used within the document. [*Example*: Consider the following image
> as an example of different themes in use applied to a presentation. In
> this example, you can see how a theme can affect font, colors,
> backgrounds, fills, and effects for different objects in a
> presentation. end example]

![Theme sample](../media/a-theme01.gif)
> In this example, we see how a theme can affect font, colors,
> backgrounds, fills, and effects for different objects in a
> presentation. *end example*]
> 
> Â© ISO/IEC29500: 2008.

The following table lists the possible child types of the Theme class.

| PresentationML Element | Open XML SDK Class | Description |
|---|---|---|
| custClrLst | CustomColorList | Custom Color List |
| extLst | ExtensionList | Extension List |
| extraClrSchemeLst | ExtraColorSchemeList | Extra Color Scheme List |
| objectDefaults | ObjectDefaults | Object Defaults |
| themeElements | ThemeElements | Theme Elements |


The following XML Schema fragment defines the four parts of the theme
element. The **themeElements** element is the
piece that holds the main formatting defined within the theme. The other
parts provide overrides, defaults, and additions to the information
contained in **themeElements**. The complex
type defining a theme, **CT\_OfficeStyleSheet**, is defined in the following
manner.

```xml
    <complexType name="CT_OfficeStyleSheet">
       <sequence>
           <element name="themeElements" type="CT_BaseStyles" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"/>
           <element name="objectDefaults" type="CT_ObjectStyleDefaults" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/>
           <element name="extraClrSchemeLst" type="CT_ColorSchemeList" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/>
           <element name="custClrLst" type="CT_CustomColorList" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/>
           <element name="extLst" type="CT_OfficeArtExtensionList" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/>
       </sequence>
       <attribute name="name" type="xsd:string" use="optional" default=""/>
    </complexType>
```

This complex type also holds a **CT\_OfficeArtExtensionList**, which is used for
future extensibility of this complex type.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## How the Sample Code Works
The sample code consists of two overloads of the method **ApplyThemeToPresentation**, and the **GetSlideLayoutType** method. The following code
segment shows the first overloaded method, in which the two presentation
files, **themePresentation** and **presentationFile**, are opened and passed to the
second overloaded method as parameters.

### [C#](#tab/cs-1)
[!code-csharp[](../../samples/presentation/apply_a_theme_to/cs/Program.cs?name=snippet2)]

### [Visual Basic](#tab/vb-1)
[!code-vb[](../../samples/presentation/apply_a_theme_to/vb/Program.vb?name=snippet2)]
***


In the second overloaded method, the code starts by checking whether any
of the presentation files is empty, in which case it throws an
exception. The code then gets the presentation part of the presentation
document by declaring a **PresentationPart**
object and setting it equal to the presentation part of the target **PresentationDocument** object passed in. It then
gets the slide master parts from the presentation parts of both objects
passed in, and gets the relationship ID of the slide master part of the
target presentation.

### [C#](#tab/cs-2)
[!code-csharp[](../../samples/presentation/apply_a_theme_to/cs/Program.cs?name=snippet3)]

### [Visual Basic](#tab/vb-2)
[!code-vb[](../../samples/presentation/apply_a_theme_to/vb/Program.vb?name=snippet3)]
***


The code then removes the existing theme part and the slide master part
from the target presentation. By reusing the old relationship ID, it
adds the new slide master part from the source presentation to the
target presentation. It also adds the theme part to the target
presentation.

### [C#](#tab/cs-3)
[!code-csharp[](../../samples/presentation/apply_a_theme_to/cs/Program.cs?name=snippet4)]

### [Visual Basic](#tab/vb-3)
[!code-vb[](../../samples/presentation/apply_a_theme_to/vb/Program.vb?name=snippet4)]
***


The code iterates through all the slide layout parts in the slide master
part and adds them to the list of new slide layouts. It specifies the
default layout type. For this example, the code for the default layout
type is "Title and Content".

### [C#](#tab/cs-4)
[!code-csharp[](../../samples/presentation/apply_a_theme_to/cs/Program.cs?name=snippet5)]

### [Visual Basic](#tab/vb-4)
[!code-vb[](../../samples/presentation/apply_a_theme_to/vb/Program.vb?name=snippet5)]
***


The code iterates through all the slide parts in the target presentation
and removes the slide layout relationship on all slides. It uses the
**GetSlideLayoutType** method to find the
layout type of the slide layout part. For any slide with an existing
slide layout part, it adds a new slide layout part of the same type it
had previously. For any slide without an existing slide layout part, it
adds a new slide layout part of the default type.

### [C#](#tab/cs-5)
[!code-csharp[](../../samples/presentation/apply_a_theme_to/cs/Program.cs?name=snippet6)]

### [Visual Basic](#tab/vb-5)
[!code-vb[](../../samples/presentation/apply_a_theme_to/vb/Program.vb?name=snippet6)]
***

To get the type of the slide layout, the code uses the **GetSlideLayoutType** method that takes the slide
layout part as a parameter, and returns to the second overloaded **ApplyThemeToPresentation** method a string that
represents the name of the slide layout type

### [C#](#tab/cs-6)
[!code-csharp[](../../samples/presentation/apply_a_theme_to/cs/Program.cs?name=snippet7)]

### [Visual Basic](#tab/vb-6)
[!code-vb[](../../samples/presentation/apply_a_theme_to/vb/Program.vb?name=snippet7)]
***
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Sample Code
The following is the complete sample code to copy a theme from one
presentation to another. To use the program, you must create two
presentations, a source presentation with the theme you would like to
copy, for example, Myppt9-theme.pptx, and the other one is the target
presentation, for example, Myppt9.pptx. You can use the following call
in your program to perform the copying.

### [C#](#tab/cs-7)
[!code-csharp[](../../samples/presentation/apply_a_theme_to/cs/Program.cs?name=snippet8)]

### [Visual Basic](#tab/vb-7)
[!code-vb[](../../samples/presentation/apply_a_theme_to/vb/Program.vb?name=snippet8)]
***


After performing that call you can inspect the file Myppt2.pptx, and you
would see the same theme of the file Myppt9-theme.pptx.

### [C#](#tab/cs)
[!code-csharp[](../../samples/presentation/apply_a_theme_to/cs/Program.cs?name=snippet9)]

### [Visual Basic](#tab/vb)
[!code-vb[](../../samples/presentation/apply_a_theme_to/vb/Program.vb?name=snippet9)]
