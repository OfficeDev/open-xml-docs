> Interested in developing solutions that extend the Office experience across [multiple platforms](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/overview/office-add-in-availability)? Check out the new [Office Add-ins model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/overview/office-add-ins). Office Add-ins have a small footprint compared to VSTO Add-ins and solutions, and you can build them by using almost any web programming technology, such as HTML5, JavaScript, CSS3, and XML.
