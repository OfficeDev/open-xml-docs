## Basic Presentation Document Structure 

The basic document structure of a **PresentationML** document consists of a number of
parts, among which is the main part that contains the presentation
definition. The following text from the [ISO/IEC 29500](https://www.iso.org/standard/71691.html) specification
introduces the overall form of a **PresentationML** package.

> The main part of a **PresentationML** package
> starts with a presentation root element. That element contains a
> presentation, which, in turn, refers to a **slide** list, a *slide master* list, a *notes
> master* list, and a *handout master* list. The slide list refers to
> all of the slides in the presentation; the slide master list refers to
> the entire slide masters used in the presentation; the notes master
> contains information about the formatting of notes pages; and the
> handout master describes how a handout looks.
> 
> A *handout* is a printed set of slides that can be provided to an
> *audience*.
> 
> As well as text and graphics, each slide can contain *comments* and
> *notes*, can have a *layout*, and can be part of one or more *custom
> presentations*. A comment is an annotation intended for the person
> maintaining the presentation slide deck. A note is a reminder or piece
> of text intended for the presenter or the audience.
> 
> Other features that a **PresentationML**
> document can include the following: *animation*, *audio*, *video*, and
> *transitions* between slides.
> 
> A **PresentationML** document is not stored
> as one large body in a single part. Instead, the elements that
> implement certain groupings of functionality are stored in separate
> parts. For example, all comments in a document are stored in one
> comment part while each slide has its own part.

The following XML code example represents a presentation that contains
two slides denoted by the IDs 267 and 256.

```xml
    <p:presentation xmlns:p="…" … > 
       <p:sldMasterIdLst>
          <p:sldMasterId
             xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId1"/>
       </p:sldMasterIdLst>
       <p:notesMasterIdLst>
          <p:notesMasterId
             xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId4"/>
       </p:notesMasterIdLst>
       <p:handoutMasterIdLst>
          <p:handoutMasterId
             xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId5"/>
       </p:handoutMasterIdLst>
       <p:sldIdLst>
          <p:sldId id="267"
             xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId2"/>
          <p:sldId id="256"
             xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId3"/>
       </p:sldIdLst>
           <p:sldSz cx="9144000" cy="6858000"/>
       <p:notesSz cx="6858000" cy="9144000"/>
    </p:presentation>
```

Using the Open XML SDK, you can create document structure and
content using strongly-typed classes that correspond to PresentationML
elements. You can find these classes in the [DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Presentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/office/documentformat.openxml.presentation.aspx)
namespace. The following table lists the class names of the classes that
correspond to the **sld**, **sldLayout**, **sldMaster**, and **notesMaster** elements.

| PresentationML Element | Open XML SDK Class | Description |
|---|---|---|
| sld | [Slide](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/office/documentformat.openxml.presentation.slide.aspx) | Presentation Slide. It is the root element of SlidePart. |
| sldLayout | [SlideLayout](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/office/documentformat.openxml.presentation.slidelayout.aspx) | Slide Layout. It is the root element of SlideLayoutPart. |
| sldMaster | [SlideMaster](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/office/documentformat.openxml.presentation.slidemaster.aspx) | Slide Master. It is the root element of SlideMasterPart. |
| notesMaster | [NotesMaster](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/office/documentformat.openxml.presentation.notesmaster.aspx) | Notes Master (or handoutMaster). It is the root element of NotesMasterPart. |
