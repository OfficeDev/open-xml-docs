# Search and replace text in a document part

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for
Office to programmatically search and replace a text value in a word
processing document.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Packages and Document Parts 
An Open XML document is stored as a package, whose format is defined by
[ISO/IEC 29500-2](https://www.iso.org/standard/71691.html). The
package can have multiple parts with relationships between them. The
relationship between parts controls the category of the document. A
document can be defined as a word-processing document if its
package-relationship item contains a relationship to a main document
part. If its package-relationship item contains a relationship to a
presentation part it can be defined as a presentation document. If its
package-relationship item contains a relationship to a workbook part, it
is defined as a spreadsheet document. In this how-to topic, you will use
a word-processing document package.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Getting a WordprocessingDocument Object 
In the sample code, you start by opening the word processing file by
instantiating the **[WordprocessingDocument](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/office/documentformat.openxml.packaging.wordprocessingdocument.aspx)** class as shown in
the following **using** statement. In the same
statement, you open the word processing file *document* by using the
**[Open](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/office/cc562234.aspx)** method, with the Boolean parameter set
to **true** to enable editing the document.

```csharp
    using (WordprocessingDocument wordDoc = 
            WordprocessingDocument.Open(document, true))
    {
        // Insert other code here.
    }
```

```vb
    Using wordDoc As WordprocessingDocument = WordprocessingDocument.Open(document, True)
        ' Insert other code here.
    End Using
```

The **using** statement provides a recommended
alternative to the typical .Open, .Save, .Close sequence. It ensures
that the **Dispose** method (internal method
used by the Open XML SDK to clean up resources) is automatically called
when the closing brace is reached. The block that follows the **using** statement establishes a scope for the
object that is created or named in the **using** statement, in this case *wordDoc*. Because
the **WordprocessingDocument** class in the
Open XML SDK automatically saves and closes the object as part of its
**System.IDisposable** implementation, and
because **Dispose** is automatically called
when you exit the block, you do not have to explicitly call **Save** and **Close**â”€as
long as you use **using**.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Sample Code 
The following example demonstrates a quick and easy way to search and
replace. It may not be reliable because it retrieves the XML document in
string format. Depending on the regular expression you might
unintentionally replace XML tags and corrupt the document. If you simply
want to search a document, but not replace the contents you can use
*MainDocumentPart.Document.InnerText*.

This example also shows how to use a regular expression to search and
replace the text value, "Hello world!" stored in a word processing file
named "MyPkg8.docx," with the value "Hi Everyone!". To call the method
**SearchAndReplace**, you can use the following
example.

```csharp
    SearchAndReplace(@"C:\Users\Public\Documents\MyPkg8.docx");
```

```vb
    SearchAndReplace("C:\Users\Public\Documents\MyPkg8.docx")
```

After running the program, you can inspect the file to see the change in
the text, "Hello world!"

The following is the complete sample code in both C\# and Visual Basic.
