# Welcome to the Open XML SDK for Office

This content set provides documentation and guidance for the
strongly-typed classes in the Open XML SDK for Office.

The SDK is built on the **System.IO.Packaging**
API and provides strongly-typed classes to manipulate documents that
adhere to the Office Open XML File Formats Specification. The Office
Open XML File Formats specification is an open, international,
[ECMA-376, Second Edition](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-376.htm)
and [ISO/IEC 29500](http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=51463)
standard. The Open XML file formats are useful for developers because
they are an open standard and are based on well-known technologies: ZIP
and XML.

The Open XML SDK simplifies the task of manipulating Open XML
packages and the underlying Open XML schema elements within a package.
The Open XML SDK encapsulates many common tasks that developers
perform on Open XML packages, so that you can perform complex operations
with just a few lines of code.

Portions of ISO/IEC 29500:2008<sup>1</sup> are referenced in the SDK.
