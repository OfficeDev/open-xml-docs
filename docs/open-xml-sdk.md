# Welcome to the Open XML SDK for Office

This content set provides documentation and guidance for the
strongly-typed classes in the Open XML SDK for Office.

The SDK is built on the **System.IO.Packaging**
API and provides strongly-typed classes to manipulate documents that
adhere to the Office Open XML File Formats specification. The Office
Open XML File Formats specification is an open, international,
[ECMA-376, 5th Edition](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-376/)
and [!include[ISO/IEC 29500 URL](./includes/iso-iec-29500-link.md)]
standard. The Open XML file formats are useful for developers because
they are an open standard and are based on well-known technologies: ZIP
and XML.

The Open XML SDK simplifies the task of manipulating Open XML
packages and the underlying Open XML schema elements within a package.
The Open XML SDK encapsulates many common tasks that developers
perform on Open XML packages, so that you can perform complex operations
with just a few lines of code.

Portions of [!include[ISO/IEC 29500 version](./includes/iso-iec-29500-version.md)]<sup>1</sup> are referenced in the SDK.
